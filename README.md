## Summary
One drawback of this webpage is the exactness of the search criteria needed to properly filter.  Although placeholders are provided, there could still be confusion on the user's part that results in inproperly formatted input.  Future developement might include looser search criteria that allows for mixed cases and/or wildcard searches.  Another suggestion would be to add the abilty to sort the results alphabetically or chronologically.  Additionally, since the logic of the table filters build on one another the only way to clear the table and start over is to refresh the page.  The filter function requires updates to handle the deletion of criteria as a change in criteria that prompts the tables to refresh.
